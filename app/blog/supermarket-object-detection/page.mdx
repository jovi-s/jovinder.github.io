# Supermarket Object Detection

This project describes the development and prediction model considerations of an 
object detection system for retail items.

Ideally, the goal is to automate parts of the retailing experience, namely the 
checkout procedure in a retail store. This is to be achieved by tracking and 
identifying objects that the customer puts in their physical shopping cart, and 
then using this information to build a "virtual shopping cart", which would 
potentially remove the need for a cashier to scan the items and handle payments 
in a convenience store.

Code can be found [here](https://github.com/jovi-s/supermarket-object-detection).
