# Job Description Keywords

This project aims to extract keywords from a set of LinkedIn job postings.

This is done via scraping from LinkedIn jobs search URL, https://www.linkedin.com/jobs. 
The user is encouraged to select relevant filters for a more precise search regarding 
specific jobs. Scraping is done using Selenium and the results are saved into a 
.xlsx file for further use. An automatic webpage should open and the program will 
automatically click, and copy the relevant information. This is done through going 
into 'inspect' and via finding elements by xpath, class_name, tag_name, css_selector 
from the webpage.

Regex is used on the job description column of the dataframe to clean it, a custom 
dataset of non essential words are removed from the text and words are then lemmatized 
using WordNetLemmatizer. A corpus is formed from the column and "english" stop words 
are removed and finally keyword extraction is done using TF-IDF or KeyBert. The user 
has the option to select which method to use from the command line.
